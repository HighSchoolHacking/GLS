# Contributing

First off, thanks for your interest in GLS!
GLS is an experimental syntax that provides a unified way to describe code.
It's very new and very untested, so don't expect everything to work.

Development respects the GitHub way of life.
Any changes should have an [issue](https://github.com/general-language-syntax/GLS/issues) [filed](https://github.com/general-language-syntax/GLS/issues/new) before a [pull request](https://github.com/general-language-syntax/GLS/pulls) is sent from a repository fork.

Issues tagged with [#hacktoberfest](https://github.com/general-language-syntax/GLS/labels/hacktoberfest) are recommended starting points for new contributors.
Feel free to tackle any other tagged issues if you're feeling confident!

See [development.md](https://github.com/general-language-syntax/GLS/blob/master/docs/development.md) for documentation on working with the GLS source code.
