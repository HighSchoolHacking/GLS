## Why?

<!-- In more detail: why do you want this? What purpose does it serve? -->

## Compiled language equivalents

<!--
If you don't yet know what the command should compile to in each language, it's fine to just delete this entire section.

Otherwise, for each supported language if you can, it'd be great if you could fill in:
* Code block showing what the above snippet
* If the command returns anything, what it should return
    * If it's different per language, put that under each language
* Reference link for the language's preferred documentation website
