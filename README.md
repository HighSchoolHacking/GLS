# GLS - General Language Syntax

A unified syntax that compiles into a number of OOP languages.


## Theory

Most object-oriented programming languages today are "pretty much" the same. Declaring variables, PEMDAS operations, calling functions, and so on rarely change; the base concept of a compiled or scripting language with managed memory is very common.

GLS provides a common syntax to describe programming functionality in these common managed languages. `.gls` files can be compiled into any of the supported languages, and will work approximately the same in all of them.


## Syntax

Each line in GLS consists of a function, a colon, and any number of arguments, all separated by spaces.

```gls
print line : "GLS!"
```

* Function: `print`
* Argument: `"GLS!"`

`print line : GLS` will compile to `System.Console.WriteLine("GLS!");` in C#, `console.log("GLS!");` in TypeScript, and so on.

### Parenthesis

You can keep spaces inside your arguments by wrapping characters in parenthesis. This tells the compiler to treat the space as part of the argument instead of a separator.

```gls
print line : ("Hello world!")
```

* Function: `print`
* Argument: `"Hello world!"`

### Recursion

To pipe the output of one command into another, wrap the inner command with `{}` brackets.

```gls
print line : { operation : 1 plus 2 }
```

### Tidbits

* Each GLS command is *idempotent* - it doesn't know or care about any preceding or following commands.

## Intentionally Missing Items

No language is perfect. The following are some seemingly obvious omissions in GLS that are due to languages not supporting them:

| Feature               | C# | Java      | Python    | Ruby      | TypeScript  |
|-----------------------|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Enums Without Values  |    |           |           | *Missing* |             |
| Foreach Over Values   |    |           |           |           |  *Missing*  |
| Multiline Lambdas     |    |           | *Missing* |           |             |
| Optional Parameters   |    | *Missing* |           |           |             |
| Overloaded Functions  |    |           | *Missing* | *Missing* |  *Missing*  |
| String.Replace        |    |           |           |           |  *Abnormal* |
| Switch Statements     |    |           | *Missing* |           |             |

This list will grow as features are requested.


## Intentionally Unsupported Languages

Not all languages work similarly to the supported ones. These will likely never receive GLS support, for the following common reasons (among others):

| Language             | Manual Pointers | Unusual Classes  |
| ---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| C                    | *✓*             | *✓*              |
| C++                  | *✓*             |                  |
| JavaScript (<ES6)    |                 | *✓*              |
| Rust                 | *✓*             |                  |

This list will grow as languages are requested.


## Development

This requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). To initialize your build environment, run:
